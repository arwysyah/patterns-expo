# Design Patterns and MVVM in EXPO

## Overview

This is a simple project built with Expo, aimed at demonstrating various **design patterns** and the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture in a mobile application.

The main goal of this project is to experiment with and apply several common design patterns to a To-Do application, including but not limited to:
- Factory
- Singleton
- Builder
- Command
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture

The app supports functionality such as adding, deleting, undo/redo tasks, and handling both personal and office tasks. Office tasks include additional fields for description, clock-in, and clock-out estimation.

### Features:
- Add tasks (Personal or Office)
- Edit and delete tasks
- Undo and redo actions
- Office tasks have additional fields: description, clock-in, and clock-out estimation

This project was created to play and explore how to structure a React Native application using these design patterns and MVVM.
